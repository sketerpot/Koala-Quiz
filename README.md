Koala Quiz
==========

This is some really basic software for a quiz/test web site. It runs
under Google App Engine. To run it, download the App Engine SDK and
use the development web server:

    $ dev_appserver.py /path/to/koalaquiz

Then point your web browser at http://localhost:8080/ to see the web
site. This loads changes to the source as soon as you make them, so
it's very convenient for testing.

The "official" copy of the web site is currently located at
[http://koalaquiz.appspot.com/](http://koalaquiz.appspot.com/) and you
can see it in action there.

Contributing
------------

If you'd like to contribute, just get the source from Github and send
in patches. If you'd like administrator permissions on the appspot.com
site, just email or PM me.

The code is a bit of a mess right now, since a lot of the CSS was
modified from [QUnit's
CSS](http://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/qunit/qunit.css) and
the whole thing was hacked together quickly.

No matter what your level of skill, please feel free to hack on
this. Have fun, and don't hesitate to ask questions if there's
something unclear.
